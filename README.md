# HHO-Lapl-OM
Octave/Matlab code for Hybrid High Order (HHO) scheme for Laplace equation

HHO methods, as well as other high-order methods for generic polytopal meshes, are not well suited to high-level interpreted langages such as Octave/Matlab. Except for the simplest test cases (low degrees, meshes moderately large), the computational resources required to run these methods are often beyond the limitations of these softwares. This library is solely provided as an initial entry point into the basic programming of HHO schemes. 

For a more advanced usage of HHO methods, compiled langages are required. A C++ library for HHO schemes is available here: https://github.com/jdroniou/HArDCore


This library was originally developped by Daniel Anderson, and then modified by Hanz Martin Cheng.
